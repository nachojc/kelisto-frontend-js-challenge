## ‚ú®  Introduction

Welcome to the coding challenge for developers interested in **frontend** roles in Kelisto. It's not an against-the-clock time challenge - you can complete it at home in your own time.

Ideally you will return your submission in __within 2 days__ - the sooner you get your submission back to us, the more quickly we can progress your application to interview stage. Based on previous candidate experiences, we believe **it will take you between 1 to 4 hours to complete the challenge.**

## The Challenge

Build a small React app that visualizes a Shopping Cart. It consists in two different parts:

  1. [Modeling business rules](#modeling-business-rules).
  2. [Layout and React usage](#layout-and-react-usage).

## Modeling business rules

- Implement a check-out system that fulfills business requirements.
- __Files related to this part of the challenge should be included within `src/domain` folder.__

> We expect only **plain classes and objects** to solve this part of the challenge, so it could let you isolate business rules than UI.

### Business requirements

- [ ] Build a check-out system.
- [¬†] Our check-out let us to scan items.
- [ ] Our check-out can calculate the total price of those scanned items.
- [ ] We sell only three kind of items:

| Item code | Name | Price |
|:---:|---|---:|
|¬†GR1 | Green tea | ¬£3.11 |
|¬†SR1 | Strawberries | ¬£5.00 |
|¬†CF1 | Coffee | ¬£11.23 |

- [ ] Our check-out support receiving different pricing rules to handle different discounts depending on the scanned items. These are the pricing rules:
  - `buy-one-get-one-free` offers and of green tea.
  - Buying strawberries to get a price discount for bulk purchases. If you buy 3 or more strawberries, the price should drop to ¬£4.50.
- [ ] Our check-out can scan items in any order, and because the product team change their minds often, it needs to be flexible regarding our pricing rules.

#### Usage

- The interface to our check-out looks like this:

```js
const co = new Checkout(pricing_rules)

co.scan(item)
co.scan(item)

const price = co.total
```

#### Test data

```
Basket: GR1,SR1,GR1,GR1,CF1
Total price expected: ¬£22.45

Basket: GR1,GR1
Total price expected: ¬£3.11

Basket: SR1,SR1,GR1,SR1
Total price expected: ¬£16.61
```

## Layout and React usage

- Implement the layout (components) that fulfills product requirements.
- __Files related to this part of the challenge should be included within `src/ui` folder.__

> To handle all the business logic, use domain objects created in the first part of this challenge.

### Product Requirements

As a buyer:

- [ ] I want to see a list of availables items on the left-hand side of the screen (block Products).
- [ ] I want to show the following information for each item in the list: name of the product, price and the product code.
- [ ] I want to be able to add items to the check-out cart (scan).
    - When the user clicks on "Add to the cart" link, it increments the quantity of items added to the cart.
- [ ] I want to show a list of items added to the cart on the right-hand side of the screen (block Cart)
- [ ] I want to show the name of the item and the quantity of them added to the cart.
- [ ] I want to show the total price of the cart based on business rules.

## üéÅ Bonus Round (not required but nice-to-have)

- Responsiveness
- Deploy the app somewhere
- Add unit tests
- Add end-to-end tests
- Dockerize the app
- Surprise us‚Ä¶

## üíØ How we're evaluating the result

Prioritised from most important to least important, here's our evaluation criteria:

- __Architecting.__ Is the app isolating business logic than UI? Are you using any software pattern?
- __Code Quality.__ Is the code clean, well-structured and easy to understand?
- __UI/UX.__ Is the app working well on both desktop and mobile?
- __Testing.__ Did you write tests?
- __The extra mile.__ Did you document your solution? ([use the `ABOUT.md` file](https://github.com/kelkoo-services/kelisto-frontend-js-challenge/blob/master/ABOUT.md))

You do not need to hit all points, but obviously, the more the better :)

## üöÄ Project submitting

To send us your code, you can:

- Make a fork of this repository, and send us a pull-request;
- or give access to your repository in Github/Bitbucket.

## ü§ò What‚Äôs next?

Once you submit your solution, our team will review your code challenge, taking your experience level into account. The sample code provided by you should be in a state considered as a "production" ready - where each requested element is prepared and potentially ready to review with your colleagues.

Good luck!

**‚ÄúThe Challenge‚Äù has been created with the sole intention of being used as a guiding document for the current recruitment process. This means we won't be using it (all or parts of it) within our projects.**
